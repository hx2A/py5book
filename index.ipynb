    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have Java 17 installed on your computer, you can install py5 using pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install py5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "[Detailed installation instructions](/content/install) are available on this website. There are some [Special Notes for Mac Users](/content/macos_users) that you should read if you use macOS.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "py5 is an excellent choice for educators looking to teach Python in the\n",
    "context of creative coding and is currently used in classrooms all around the world.\n",
    "This website's documentation includes\n",
    "[introductory tutorials](/tutorials/intro_to_py5_and_python) as well as extensive\n",
    "[reference documentation](/reference/summary), complete with example code.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are currently [five basic ways to use py5](/content/py5_modes). They are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **module mode**: create a sketch with `setup()` and `draw()` functions that call methods provided by the `py5` library.\n",
    "* **class mode**: create a Python class inherited from `py5.Sketch`. This mode supports multiple Sketches running at the same time.\n",
    "* **imported mode**: simplified code that omits the `py5.` prefix. This mode is supported by the py5 Jupyter notebook kernel and the `run_sketch` command line utility. The above example is created in imported mode.\n",
    "* **static mode**: functionless code to create static images. This mode is supported by the py5bot Jupyter notebook kernel, the `%%py5bot` IPython magic, and the `run_sketch` command line utility.\n",
    "* **processing mode**: make calls to Python from a Processing (Java) Sketch. This mode enables py5 to function as bridge, connecting the Python and Java ecosystems through a new `callPython()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Source Code\n",
    "\n",
    "py5 was created by the artist and software developer [Jim Schmitz](https://ixora.io/) ([@hx2A](https://github.com/hx2A/))\n",
    "starting in March of 2020. The library is the foundation of his [art practice](https://ixora.io/art/).\n",
    "\n",
    "New py5 features and bug fixes are being added to py5 every day. The library is always\n",
    "in active development and is well maintained.\n",
