    "## reading external data\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're storing data in py5 - whether that data is lines of text, mathematical formulas or image files - you'll often find that manually inserting all this data into the code itself is unnecessarily time-consuming, or doesn't quite fit your needs. This is especially noticeable if you begin using py5 for purposes of data visualization. If you were taking data from a spreadsheet and trying to manually insert it into lists so you could visualize it, you'd get frustrated very quickly (especially when the data in that spreadsheet might change!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, there are ways to use external data inside of py5. Other tutorials may have asked you to display images in your sketch using the `load_image()` and `image()` functions. In this tutorial, we'll discuss how to read text data into py5 from external files, and utilize it for data visualization. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to clarify that we're talking about *plain text*, which has no special visual styling by itself. Plain text can come in many different forms, however. These could be files ending in .txt, .html, .xml... and even the .py files that py5 produces. Opening any of these files up in a standard text editor will allow you to read the contents, even if the structure can differ greatly between file formats. For example, opening a list of your favorite songs you've saved in a .txt file may look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Breathe, by Pink Floyd, on the album The Dark Side of the Moon\n",
    "Speak To Me, by Pink Floyd, on the album The Dark Side of the Moon\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "An .html file you'd created to list these songs on your webpage would probably include extra formatting information:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<b>Breathe</b>, by <em>Pink Floyd</em>, on the album <u>The Dark Side of the Moon</u>\n",
    "<b>Speak To Me</b>, by <em>Pink Floyd</em>, on the album <u>The Dark Side of the Moon</u>\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And if you'd asked an audio player like VLC to export your playlist as XML, it would have even more contextual information:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n",

To introduce you to the concept, however, we'll be looking at a format that has a much simpler syntax -- *Comma-Separated Value* files.
