For example, if you were storing the name and age of a student to be used later in your program, you could have a *string* variable for their name, and an *integer* for their age.\n",

You may have never worked with a list before, but you can probably get some idea of the syntax just by looking at it. A key thing to know about lists is that they are *ordered*, and this order stays the same. If you wanted to store all of your students in a single list, you might just know that the order will always be a student name followed by their age, and these values won't ever float between students or become mixed up. \n",
