    "# three-dimensional graphics in py5\n",
    "\n",
    "These tutorials have revolved around the use of two-dimensional graphics in a two-dimensional space. By now, you'll likely be familiar with the way that coordinates work in py5: `0,0` is the top-left corner of the sketch window, and increasing those numbers can move something along the X axis (left to right) or the Y axis (top to bottom). \n",
    "\n",
    "The two-dimensional graphics you might draw in this space (like rectangles, circles and complex polyhedrons) are rendered using the built-in py5 renderer. However, this is not the only type of renderer available. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can actually define the renderer py5 will use in an optional argument when you size your sketch with `size()`. Although there are quite a few interesting options to choose from (P2D, P3D, FX2D, PDF and SVG), in this tutorial, we'll be looking at the P3D renderer, which can be used to draw in a three-dimensional space. \n",
    "\n",
    "The P3D renderer (Processing 3D) is a three-dimensional graphics renderer that makes use of OpenGL-compatible graphics hardware. This means that its ability to render quickly and efficiently will depend on your computer's graphics card, but it's a worthy trade-off to have access to three-dimensional shapes (and for most devices, it will still be quite speedy). \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we draw anything, or even change the renderer to P3D, we need to talk about how we position objects in 3D space. First, we'll have to look beyond the `x, y` positioning system, since it only accounts for two dimensions. In a 3D space, we'll be using `x, y, z` positioning to place objects. The Z axis is our missing third dimension. A negative Z value will move a 3D object \"farther away\" from the viewer, and a positive Z value will move it \"closer\" to the viewer. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, we also need to address the expectations you may have on *how* you can position these objects in 3D space. When drawing a 2D object, like a `rect()`, you typically pass it arguments to position it, as well as to size it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "rect(x,y,w,h) # X and Y position, then width and height\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When we're drawing a 3D shape, like a `box()`, you might expect we should give it X, Y and Z positions. However, rendering the positions of objects works a little differently in 3D. The positions of any shape in this 3D space will be adjusted a bit to provide the 3D illusion -- so we can't anticipate that the corners of a `box()`, for example, will be *exactly* where we would like it to be. However, the P3D renderer will do its best to position any shape we give it according to any `translate()` functions we've used. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start drawing 3D shapes, we can draw 2D shapes in a 3D space to get used to the concept. The code below shows how a three-dimensional `translate()` function works. This is how we'll be positioning our three-dimensional objects, too."

    "\n",
    "Since you're using `translate()` to position your boxes, spheres and other shapes, accessing their position can sometimes feel a bit tricky. If I wanted to move two shapes, but at very different points in my code, I would likely be using `push_matrix()` and `pop_matrix()` to reset or clear out my `translate()` function. This means that if I moved a box *somewhere*, moving a rectangle to that same *somewhere* might require carefully tracking those positioning changes. After all, when a series of rotations and translations has been done, straightforward coordinates like `0,0,0` or `34, 50, 100` are no longer inherently meaningful.\n",

    "Luckily, a trio of functions makes this a little easier. Using `model_x()`, `model_y()` and `model_z()` can allow us to find the current *translated* location of any coordinates. In the below code, X, Y and Z are changing each frame, and then being used for our translation function, all wrapped inside of a matrix so that they wouldn't change the location of any subsequent shapes. However, we can easily find out where `0,0,0` (or any other location) would be in this matrix using `model_x()`, `model_y()` and `model_z()`."

For the purposes of this demo, we're using Suzanne, the unofficial mascot of the 3D modeling program Blender.
