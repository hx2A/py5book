    "In this tutorial, we'll be exploring some features outside of py5's usual toolbox; namely, a library we can import in order to simulate two-dimensional physics. More specifically, we'll be simulating *rigid bodies* which have a variety of forces applied to them, such as gravity. You can think of a rigid body as any object that doesn't deform at all when it hits things or moves around. Although a *perfectly* rigid body may not exist in the real world (everything will deform if it's moving fast enough, or is hit with enough force), a metal spoon is much closer to being a rigid body than a gummy bear. For the purposes of simplified simulations that don't need to be perfectly accurate, such as those in video games, simulating these kinds of stiff objects is done with rigid bodies to save on computational power.\n",
    "\n",
    "The library we'll be using in this tutorial is called *[Pymunk](http://www.pymunk.org/en/latest/)*. Pymunk will give us access to four basic classes -- the *space* is like the world in which we'll be simulating some physics, and inside of this space we'll have rigid bodies, *collision shapes* (to manually define which parts of a rigid body will be able to collide with other entities) and *constraints/joints* (which can connect two rigid bodies, or restrict how far they can get from each other). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple different ways to use the Pymunk library, and you can find more information on these methods on the [Pymunk installation page](http://www.pymunk.org/en/latest/installation.html). However, for the sake of simplicity, we'll be using the Thonny IDE and its ability to manage packages for us. \n",
    "\n",
    "## py5 in Thonny\n",
    "\n",
    "Thonny is an *integrated development environment* (or IDE) for working with Python, and includes a plugin specifically for using py5. First, you'll want to [install the correct version of Thonny and the py5mode plugin](https://pypi.org/project/thonny-py5mode/). Once the process is complete, you can navigate to *Tools > Manage Packages*, search for `pymunk` and install it. As with using other files, we'll begin our sketch with an *import* line so that our program knows we want to use all the nifty features and classes included with Pymunk. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the regular code we might use to create an animated py5 sketch (the code in `setup()` that runs once, and the code in `draw()` that runs every frame) we'll be starting by creating a Pymunk \"space\", and directly setting its gravity using the *gravity* attribute. Right now, this doesn't do anything visible."

When you use `pymunk.Segment()` you pass some arguments for the Pymunk body to connect to, the X and Y positions of the first point in the line, the X and Y positions of the second point in the line, and a radius for its thickness. Here, we'll be using a special case, `space.static_body`, for the body that the line is connected to. Remember when we refer to some sketches as *static* sketches, where nothing moves? In this case, a static body is a rigid body that doesn't move. \n",

Right now, we aren't using any of these arguments in the `ball_hit()` function itself.
