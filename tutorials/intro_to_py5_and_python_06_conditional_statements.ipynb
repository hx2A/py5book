    "# conditional statements\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, code written in py5 is just executed line by line, starting with the very top of the sketch and ending at the bottom. This linear arrangement of code is perfectly acceptable for simple programs, but as your sketches begin to get more complex, you'll often find that laying out divergent paths and loops of behaviors is necessary. Laying out the rules and conditions for the computer to follow these different paths is called *control flow*. \n",

    "<img src=\"images/conditional_statements/intro-flowchart.svg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "A *conditional statement* is really just a fancy way of saying that if a condition is true, the program will do something. If you were communicating with a human, it would be helpful to think of this as a question-and-answer approach, where the answer will lead to some sort of action. If you had blocks of several different colors and several different boxes to put them in, the conditional statement might look like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "*A human is shown a colored block.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Question*: Is the block red?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Answer*: Yes.\n",

    "*Action*: Place it in the box labelled \"red blocks\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The way the computerized brain works is similar, but simple conditional statements don't separate these three steps in the same way the human brain does. It's a little more like this: \n",

    "*A computer is shown a colored block.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Condition*: IF the block is red...\n",
    "\n",
    "*Action*: ...place it in the box labeled \"red blocks.\"\n",

    "There are many simple types of data in py5 (and other programming languages). Text, made of individual characters, is called a *string*, a whole number is an *integer*, and a number with a decimal point is a *float*. For comparing conditions to a target like this (*is the block red*), computers use a data type called a *boolean*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Strings can hold pretty much any text, and integers/floats pretty much any number. Booleans only have two possible states: `True` or `False`. Let's write some simple code together to demonstrate how this works."

    "So far, each of our if/elif statements have only been evaluating one thing at a time. *Is the mark greater than 50?* For more complex logic, or even to streamline the statements we've already written, you might need to ask something like *is the mark greater than 50, AND less than 65?* For this, we can use logical operators. Actually, you've already taken a sneak peek at one of them, *not*, which checks for the opposite of something. There are three of these logical operators available to us in Python: \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's incorporate *and* and *or* into our marking program to handle a few other cases. For example, if I incorrectly put in a mark as 152 or -52, it's better for the program to reject it than to mark it as an A or a FAIL. Plus, maybe if someone is in a certain range below a C, there's still a chance to retrieve their grade and ask them to resubmit. Changing the mark below, you can see the different results. That *or* operator means either condition being true will run the code, and that *and* means both must be true for the code to run."
