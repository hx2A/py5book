    "# functions in py5\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're writing large programs, you'll often find that chunks of code start running together, even with the help of comments. If you need to use the same code (or very similar code) over and over, the structure of your program can also become very inefficient. With functions, you can pare things down and keep them organized, leading to more readable and elegant code.\n",
    "\n",
    "What exactly is a *function*? We've been using them very frequently throughout the tutorials here, and the way that functions work is not exclusive to py5 or even to Python, but shared across most (if not all) different programming languages. Some examples that you've probably used very frequently are `size()`, `background()` and `rect()`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll first be examining the anatomy of a function (including the ones that come with py5) and then learning how to create our own user-defined functions.   \n",
    "\n",
    "## function names and arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "As a quick refresher, let's take a look at the structure of one basic function, `rect()`. As you likely already know, this draws a rectangle on the screen at the positions you specify. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you take a look at [the documentation for the `rect()` function](http://py5coding.org/reference/sketch_rect), you'll see we make references to *parameters*, some of which are required (like where to actually place the  rectangle, and how wide and tall it should be) and some of which are optional (like the radius for rounded corners). These parameters also have an expected data type... in this case, floats, which are numbers that may include decimal points. Trying to use some other data type, like strings of text (`rect('hello')`), would cause an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, functions are created with parameters that define the ways they work and the values they expect to receive. When we then use the function, or *call* it in our code, we refer to the values we give it as *arguments*, though you'll often see the terms used interchangeably. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you see a line of code like `rect(24, 24, 100, 100)`, even if you don't immediately know what those values do, you can tell that it's a function named *rect* that has taken four *arguments* to do something. As you might expect, when you create your own function, this is all information decided by you. \n",
    "\n",
    "## creating user-defined functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start simple with our very first function. We'll be creating a function to generate speech bubbles, like you might see in a comic strip. The first version will have no arguments at all, and we can quickly begin building upon it to create more dynamic code to be used in different situations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you've never created a function in py5 before, you may be more familiar with the process than you realize, if you've read up on other tutorials here. When we create sketches with animation or user interaction, you might recall that we make use of the `setup()` and `draw()` functions. For example, this snippet of code from another tutorial will draw an ellipse on screen wherever the mouse is clicked."
