    "# vector movement and Py5vector\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is best paired with the tutorial on Object-Oriented Programming, and will use the code created within that tutorial. If you aren't yet familiar with this concept, it's worth going back and reading through the OOP tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "The word *vector* is used in a few different ways, so let's clarify: these are not the vectors used in *vector graphics*, but Euclidean vectors, also known as *geometric vectors* or *spatial vectors*. Essentially, a vector is just a way of measuring direction and magnitude (or strength) of movement. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we're discussing movement in a real or virtual space, we might refer to the *force* at which something moves, or the *speed*, or the *distance*. If we give something (say, an amoeba, as we'll be using in the following exercises) ten seconds to move, the *distance* that it covers in that time will depend on how fast it's going (which depends on the strength of the force that was pushing it that way). This strength of movement is the *magnitude* of the vector. It doesn't inherently say anything about the distance traveled, or the direction, but it can tell you how hard something is being \"pushed\" in that direction. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the amoeba below is going to move 400 pixels to the right, we don't necessarily know how fast it's moving. However, we do know its *direction* -- to the right, along the X axis of this two-dimensional space. If we wanted to move it this direction in py5, we'd say that its X position is *increasing*. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/py5vector/400.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, much of the time directional movement isn't along just a single axis. The amoeba below is moving up and to the right, so it's moving along both the X and Y axis. Again, even without knowing its *magnitude*, we can at least know its *direction*. In py5, its X position would be *increasing* and its Y position would be *decreasing*. To accomodate for this sort of diagonal movement, two-dimensional vectors can store both an X and a Y value. In this case, the vector might be `(1, -1)` to represent movement to the right and upwards. You might not know its magnitude just by looking at it, but you can use the `.mag` method (appended to the end of any vector) to find out. In general, it's enough to point your vector in the right direction, and increase the values (like `(3, -3)`) to increase the magnitude of movement. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using the amoeba code from our OOP tutorial to start us off. Depending on if you want to have your `Amoeba` class as a separate *module* file, you'll either have two files (my suggestions for names are at the top of the following code snippets) or a single, consolidated, all-in-one file. Either will work."

    "If you like, you can add additional forces to this simulation by adding more vectors. For example, since many single-celled organisms live in water, you could define some vector for a *current* and add this *current* to Bob's location each frame, too. Of course, in addition to adding vectors, you can always subtract them. This can be useful for the reasons you might expect (like a force that pushes your amoeba in the opposite direction), but we can also use it to force our amoebas to move towards the mouse pointer. \n",

    "In py5, we have access to the `mouse_x` and `mouse_y` variables, which track the position of the mouse cursor. Since we're using vectors, and thus directions (instead of absolute positions), we won't simply be moving the amoeba to this location; we want to move it *towards* the position of `mouse_x` and `mouse_y`. This means that we'll do a bit of subtraction to find the *difference* in space between the current location of the amoeba and the position of the mouse, and move the amoeba in that direction."
