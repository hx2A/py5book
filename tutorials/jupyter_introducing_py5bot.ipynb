    "# Introducing py5bot\n",
    "\n",
    "This is py5bot. It is a simple and easy to use programming environment for teaching the very basics of Python programming and creative coding with py5.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must use the [py5bot Jupyter kernel](/content/install) to execute py5bot code.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are viewing this page from the py5 documentation website, see the Binder or Live Code options by hovering your mouse over the rocket ship icon at the top of this page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each cell in this notebook can contain a series of py5 drawing commands. The drawing commands will be executed by py5bot to create a static image that will be embedded in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main design goal is to provide a simple programming environment that is suitable for beginners. Individual programming concepts can be explained in isolation from more complicated Python concepts like functions or modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "When hosted on Jupyter Hub and paired with Jupyter Lab's \"Show Contextual Help\" feature, py5bot can become an easy to use programming environment for educators to teach Python to beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a simple example."

    "## py5bot rules\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few important rules that you should be aware of.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The [size()](/reference/sketch_size) command should be the first line of Python code. Comments are ignored. If the [size()](/reference/sketch_size) command is omitted, the output size will be 100 by 100 pixels.\n",
    "* When py5bot is run on Windows and Linux computers, you can use the `P2D` or `P3D` renderers. These OpenGL renderers are currently not supported on macOS. The `SVG` and `PDF` renderers are supported on all platforms.\n",
    "* Each cell has its own local namespace. Variables and functions defined in one cell cannot be used in another cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some less important rules that should be mentioned but aren't that important:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Calls to [smooth()](/reference/sketch_smooth) or [no_smooth()](/reference/sketch_no_smooth), if desired, should be after [size()](/reference/sketch_size) and before other Python commands.\n",
    "* A call to [pixel_density()](/reference/sketch_pixel_density) would also need to be after [size()](/reference/sketch_size) and before other Python commands, but since it just scales the size of the output, you probably shouldn't bother using it in py5bot.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's basically it."
