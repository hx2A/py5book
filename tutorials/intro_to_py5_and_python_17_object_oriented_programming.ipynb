    "# object-oriented programming (OOP)\n",
    "\n",
    "In other tutorials in this series, you have likely gotten used to the idea of working inside of one large file, and have used organizational techniques like labeling your code with comments to separate out different blocks. Although you may have dipped your toes into creating custom functions and a sensible \"flow\" for the logic of your program, there's much more that can be done in terms of keeping your code organized and making it work sensibly.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common way to approach code is called *object-oriented programming*, and it can help enormously with laying out your code and organizing the way your functions work. \n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, object-oriented programming (commonly shortened to OOP) involves the creation of a collection of data called an *object*. Before you create an individual *object*, though, you create a *class*, which is sort of like a template for how objects should behave and what sort of data they contain. This system lets you define the general features a certain class of object should have, and then automatically pass those traits on to each object you create. This is a very efficient way to deal with something that might have complex behaviors and might not be wholly unique. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, classes can be used to simulate real-life concepts, like vehicles, buildings, animals or people. They're also useful for more abstract concepts, like bank accounts, personality types, and physical forces like the weather. To wrap our heads around the concept more generally, we'll be spending this tutorial working on a class that simulates single-celled amoebas and their behavior. Once this class has been defined and given its own qualities, you'll be able to \"spawn\" individual amoebas into existence and give them their own traits. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because these amoebas will be responding to simulated physical forces, we'll also be exploring *vectors* as a way of tracking movement and position, using the Py5Vector class. These are a type of *Euclidean vector*, so we'll be dealing with some concepts of linear algebra... but even if your algebra skills are quite rusty, you'll find that py5 handles all of the difficult math for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, to aid with organizing all of this new code we'll be producing, you'll also learn to divide code into multiple files and use all of them to contribute to the same program. This will be more applicable if you're using some sort of IDE on your computer to run your code, rather than running it live on the documentation website, but is useful to explore nevertheless. \n",
    "\n",
    "## working with classes\n",
    "\n",
    "A *class* is like a blueprint for an object. If you were going to set out to create a car in real life, before you began manufacturing it you'd probably start with some kind of plan that outlines the specifications and aesthetics of the vehicle. In py5, you might start with defining a *class* for your car, so that you can specify by default that cars have four wheels, an engine, a windshield, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, some qualities will change for each individual vehicle. For example, if you want to create a red car and a blue car, you would want to be able to set the color of this individual car whenever you create a new car object. These features that can be set for each individual object are called *attributes*. In Python, something being an *attribute* just means that it's a variable that belongs to a particular class. If your car class had attributes for color, type of engine and the shape of the vehicle itself, you could always change those attributes to create many different car objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/object_oriented_programming/cars.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "*From 'Learn Python Visually', by Tristan Bunn.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, cars don't just sit there and look pretty. They have a variety of functions they can perform, like accelerating, braking and steering. If you wanted to replicate these in Python, your \"car\" class could have *methods* associated with it. You've probably seen methods throughout the rest of these tutorials, and wondered what makes them different from regular *functions*. Just like attributes are variables that are associated with a particular class, a method is a function that is associated with that class. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although we won't immediately be diving into this aspect of classes, you should know that classes can also *inherit* qualities from each other. Inheritance means that if you might be trying to represent a variety of different vehicles in a game, you could make a more general *vehicle* class, and then classes like *car* and *motorcycle* that inherit certain qualities from the generic *vehicle*. This is a fantastic way to organize different sub-types of object, but for now, just a single class will serve our purposes. \n",
    "\n",
    "## amoeba simulator\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by defining an *amoeba* class that will include both attributes and methods, so that you can easily control the appearance (and behavior) of individual amoeba objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "These won't be a scientifically accurate representation of amoebas. In fact, they'll mostly just wobble around the screen, but it will look pretty cool, and will serve as a great introduction to how classes and objects work. As an additional challenge, you can introduce *collision-detection* code that will prevent them from passing through each other. We'll be starting with the most basic form of our `Amoeba` class, and adding attributes and methods to it as we progress. \n",
    "\n",
    "The very first thing we'll do is create the class itself. If you're using an IDE on your computer to run your sketch, put this Amoeba class in its own file. Before we declare this class, we do two things: first, with the line `from py5 import *` we import all of the special functions and structures associated with py5 into this file, so we can use all of the features we expect. Then, with the line `cs = get_current_sketch()` we give this file some awareness of the currently running sketch, so that our files will easily be able to \"talk to each other\" even when the amoeba file is not running."

It'd be much more convenient if we could simply tell the program \"create an amoeba named Bob, and then display them\" rather than manually drawing circles with Bob's values. Let's create a method called `display()` that takes the values attached to an amoeba and draws them for us each time. \n",

    "There's one more change we'll have to make before we start letting our amoebas run around the screen. In the real world, an amoeba is not perfectly circular -- its surface ripples and distorts like a water balloon. We'll be replacing our `circle()` function with a series of Bezier curves to draw a wobbly amoeba. To stop us from having to calculate these points manually, we'll also be adding a new method to do a bit of that math for us. \n",

By passing it an argument based on the current frame count in our sketch, we'll get an amoeba that ripples and wiggles as time passes. You'll only need to modify your *amoeba.py* file (or the methods inside of the `Amoeba` class, if you're using a single file) to see the changes. \n",
