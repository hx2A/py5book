    "# mouse and keyboard interaction in py5\n",
    "\n",
    "Many programs written in py5, such as those we've discussed in previous tutorials, run independently of any outside input. Static sketches that produce a single frame of artwork are one example of this, but even animated sketches are often self-driven; variables can change at random or with some pre-defined pattern to move and alter shapes in real-time. Using a digital medium like py5 is a great way to create types of art, like animation, which are tedious or difficult to produce in other mediums. You can take this a step further with interactive artwork and digital games. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a variety of ways you can hook py5 sketches up to some kind of user input, including game controllers and more novel input methods like webcams and microphones. In this tutorial, we'll be starting simple, with mouse and keyboard interaction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Interactivity in py5 requires the use of both `setup()` and `draw()` blocks, so that each new frame being drawn can respond to the user input. If you're unfamiliar with these concepts, which have come up in a few other tutorials where animation comes into play, just know that `setup()` is for code which runs once -- at the beginning of the sketch loading up -- and `draw()` is for code that should run repeatedly. \n",
    "\n",
    "## mouse interaction and mouse variables\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the mouse to perform simple interactions like pointing and clicking, or more complex ones like dragging-and-dropping different elements or panning around a 3D view. Many standard computer mice have three buttons, for left-clicking, right-clicking, and center-clicking (which often doubles as a scroll wheel). \n",
    "\n",
    "py5 includes a handful of useful system variables (meaning you don't have to define them yourself, they're already understood) relating to the state of the mouse. The `mouse_x` and `mouse_y` variables refer to the current position of the pointer inside the sketch. In the example sketch below, we create a 600 by 600 pixel sketch window and use `mouse_x` and `mouse_y` to draw ellipses beneath the mouse pointer."

    "In addition to `mouse_x` and `mouse_y`, you have access to two similar variables, `pmouse_x` and `pmouse_y`. These refer to the *previous* positions of the mouse, in the frame directly before the current frame. (You might be able to think of some ways this could be useful already, like determining the direction of mouse movement by seeing where the cursor was a moment before!) \n",
    "\n",
    "The `is_mouse_pressed` variable, as the name may hint, is py5's way of knowing whether a mouse button is currently being pressed. When someone is holding down one of the mouse buttons, `is_mouse_pressed` boolean will change to `True`. You can cleverly check for this value in order to only do something when a user clicks their mouse. By modifying our earlier sketch, we can create a very rudimentary drawing program that only draws an ellipse while the mouse is being clicked or held down."

Using `pmouse_x` and `pmouse_y` to know the previous location of the mouse, we can easily swap this ellipse function out for a line. This makes things look a lot smoother, and it's more like you might expect a digital drawing program to behave."

    "In addition to the mouse variables we've just gone over -- `mouse_x`, `mouse_y`, `pmouse_x`, `pmouse_y`, `is_mouse_pressed` and `mouse_button` -- in py5 we have access to a variety of mouse *events*. These share some functionality with mouse variables, but are given their own chunks of associated code outside of the `draw()` function. While we won't be using all of them immediately, these events are `mouse_pressed()`, `mouse_released()`, `mouse_wheel()`, `mouse_clicked()`, `mouse_dragged()`, and `mouse_moved()`. These are functions of their own that listen for their corresponding mouse events and then execute some code in response. Just like `setup()` and `draw()`, you can write this code yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using the first three of those events (for pressing and releasing mouse buttons, and using the mouse wheel) to create an expanded version of our simple drawing app idea. To have better control over when our `draw()` function runs, we'll also be utilizing two functions called `no_loop()` and `loop()`. By default, everything inside of `draw()` runs once every frame. By using `no_loop()`, you can \"freeze\" the code inside of `draw()` and stop it from running. As an example, the code below will NOT fill the console with numbers, like it might normally... we've frozen the `print()` function and stopped it from running each frame."

The first time you draw anything, the *pmouse* variables will be set to the 0, 0 position, so a line connects your drawing to the upper left corner. Plus, if you stop and start drawing, your current line will be connected to the last position of the mouse.

We'll be adding an event to detect keyboard presses, and using it to select from our swatches with the keyboard. Our code is getting pretty long now... don't get lost! First, we'll be adding the `key_pressed()` function itself, and printing the value of `key`. This function will be triggered every time you press a key on your keyboard, and `key` stores the last button on the keyboard that was pressed."

    "This code draws a rectangle the same color as the background over the entire canvas (starting at the top of the screen and the edge of our palette), effectively erasing everything. However, you'll notice it currently runs every time you click once, anywhere on the screen. \n",

    "If you're stuck on ideas, take a look at the variables we have already for inspiration. The *brushshape* variable is being used for the `stroke_cap()` -- you could add buttons to toggle between the different types of caps available. What about an eraser, more color swatches, a button to save your drawing using [the `save()` function](http://py5coding.org/reference/sketch_save), or even a color mixer?  \n",

    "As you can see, code with a lot of functions and events can quickly become quite long and difficult to work through. Good work making it this far. In the next few lessons, we'll dig deeper into making your own functions, organizing your code into multiple files and other techniques that may make it all easier to wrangle."
