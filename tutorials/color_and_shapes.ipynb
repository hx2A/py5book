    "# Your first py5 sketch\n",
    "\n",
    "When we're instructing a computer to run code, we cannot use regular human language. Instead, code takes the form of an *algorithm* or a series of algorithms which are handed to the computer. Although the word algorithm has had a lot of complex recent use, at its simplest form, an algorithm is just a set of rules or instructions for a computer to follow. Unlike most humans, if a computer is given unclear instructions, it can't problem-solve its way out of the situation - it will simply stop in its tracks. This means that small errors in the syntax (grammatical structure) of your code will cause many of the problems you run into, and it will get easier as time goes on to anticipate and correct them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Get familiar with the [py5 reference](https://py5.ixora.io/reference/sketch.html) and [py5 cheatsheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tabreturn/processing.py-cheat-sheet/master/py5/py5_cc.pdf) - these will both serve as your glossary for the functions and methods we discuss here. When you're using the py5 reference pages, be aware that they use a slightly different mode, and slightly different syntax. We're using something called *static mode*, which is a simple way to get started with py5 (especially if you're using [py5bot](http://py5.ixora.io/tutorials/introduction_to_py5bot.html)). If the reference seems to be starting a lot of functions and arguments with `py5.`, or splits code up into blocks labeled with functions like `setup()` and `draw()`, you can safely omit that while using static mode. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you'll be walked through some basic functions in py5, including sizing your visual output, using color and drawing simple shapes.\n",

    "## hello world\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's make our first *sketch* in py5 (which is just what you call a program in this environment). If you're using an IDE (integrated development environment) of some kind on your computer, you'll want to start with creating a new file and saving it somewhere you can easily find again. If you're instead using this resource online, the easiest way to work with these sketches will be using the Binder or Live Code options, which you can see by hovering your mouse over the rocket ship icon at the top of this page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first sketch will be a simple \"hello world\" sketch - a concept that is common across all sorts of programming languages and environments. We'll put in only two lines to start with:"

You'll gain a better understanding of when whitespace is necessary when you begin working with more complex code.\n",

    "In a hexadecimal (or hex for short) code like this, each pair of letters or numbers represents a color. So, we can tell #FF0000 will be red because the first two digits (R) are at their highest, while the G and B digits are at their lowest. Just like mixing light in a prism, #FFFFFF (RGB all at their highest value) is white, and #000000 is black.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're drawing a picture, you might do the linework and then fill it in with color afterwards. In py5, you do this in reverse - you tell the program what color something will be *before* you create it. As an example, let's create a red rectangle in our sketch. Here are our next two functions:\n",

(This system of positioning by coordinates is common in a lot of digital spaces, and you'll get your head around it quickly if you haven't already.) Put together, and with those arguments swapped out, your code might look something like this:"

You can also change how big the outline is with `stroke_weight()` or entirely remove it with `no_stroke()`. Add a white stroke with a `stroke_weight()` of 3 above your rectangles to see how it works:"

    "\n",
    "Since a hexadecimal code is equivalent to using the RGB system, you can use straight RGB values for the same effect. By default, these values can go up to 255. For example, `fill('#FF0000')` (where FF represents the highest number possible) is equivalent to `fill(255, 0, 0)`. To get these sorts of values or convert from one to the other, remember you can utilize the *color selector* in Thonny's py5 mode. Why would you want to use one over the other? Well, if you had a program that had to change color, it would be a lot easier to simply add to the red, green or blue color value than to calculate the differences between hex codes. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you wanted to use HSB (hue, saturation, brightness) instead, you can use a function called `color_mode()` in your sketch, before you start coloring things in. In the *color selector*, you will quickly discover that the *hue* can be anywhere from 0 to 360 (like the degrees of a circle), and *saturation* and *brightness* can be anywhere from 0 to 100. This mimics the HSB system in many drawing programs. Making this system work in your code is pretty straightforward. To use `color_mode()` you need the following arguments: \n",

    "`color_mode(TYPE, maximum value, maximum value, maximum value)`\n",

    "... which in this case means ...\n",
    "\n",
    "`color_mode(HSB, 360, 100, 100)`\n",
    "\n",
    "In HSB mode, that bright red color we represented as `fill(255, 0, 0)` would instead be `fill(0, 100, 100)` or `fill(360, 100, 100)` - since the hue range is \"circular\" and loops back in on itself, either will work. That's a color at the red point of the hue range, with maximum brightness and saturation. Why would you want to use HSB? Think again about a program that might have to change its colors while it runs. If you could simply add to the number representing hue and cycle through the rainbow that way, it would be a lot easier than manually working out how to do that with RGB values!\n",

    "This is the final challenge for this week. You'll be handing it in on Stream as your homework. Before we get to the task at hand, let's introduce the `arc()` function. This is used to draw elliptical arcs - and it's best to try it out to understand how it works. Start a new sketch with *File > New*, save it with *File > Save*, and name it **disk_space_analyser**. Here's your setup code:\n",

    "Breaking the `arc()` down across multiple lines will make it a little easier to examine its parts. Here are its required arguments. \n",

    "If you take a look at the [py5 cheatsheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tabreturn/processing.py-cheat-sheet/master/py5/py5_cc.pdf) (also accessible in the *py5* menu in Thonny), you'll see arcs on the lower right here. We use *radians* to measure where an arc ends and begins. Add an arc with a starting angle of zero radians and an ending angle of two radians:\n",

    "We started at zero radians, and our arc is being drawn clockwise. You may notice 2 radians is... well, a little more than a quarter of a way around the circle, which can feel quite unhelpful. Rather than trying to strictly remember exactly how much a single radian is, it can be better to remember that halfway around a circle is *pi* radians - that funny number starting with 3.1415. This animated diagram from Wikipedia is also helpful:\n",
