# How To Contribute

[Contributing to open source projects isn't just about writing code](https://klarasystems.com/articles/contributing-to-open-source-beyond-software-development/). This is especially true for py5 because much of the coding efforts are taken care of for us by the Processing team. Therefore, non-coding contributions are even more meaningful and valuable.

Below is a current list of suggested ways to contribute. This list will grow as the project grows.

## Say Thank You

Do you enjoy using py5? What are you using py5 for? Don't keep it to yourself! It's a thrill to hear from our users. Seriously, it provides an enormous amount of encouragement to hear from someone who is excited about py5. On Twitter, find us at [@py5coding](https://twitter.com/py5coding) or use the hashtag [#py5](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23py5&f=live). You can also use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/py5coding/py5generator/discussions) for more involved conversations.

## Use py5 and Report Bugs

Whi

Many improvements to py5 have come from ordinary conversations with users

If you get stuck somewhere, we'd like to know. Our goal is for py5's documentation to be clear and accessible to users. If you get tripped up by something, that's useful information for us about where the documentation needs improvement.

## Contribute to Processing

Internally, py5 relies on Processing's core library (written in Java) for many of its features. Processing's core library is maintained by a different team in the Processing community. Any bug fixes or enhancements to Processing will also benefit py5. Therefore, a contribution to Processing is a contribution to py5. The Processing team works very hard maintaining a large code base; anything that makes their lives easier would be a big help to both them and us.

## Teach Others About py5

Because of py5's reliance on Processing's core library, much of the coding work is already taken care of. Therefore, other aspects of the project such as tutorials and documentation become even more important.

## Libraries

Both Processing and p5.js have a large collection of user contributed libraries. Currently, py5 has none. Would you like to create and maintain one? If so, [let us know what you'd like to build](https://github.com/py5coding/py5generator/discussions). If you would need an idea, have a look at the [Processing libraries](https://processing.org/reference/libraries/) and the [p5.js libraries](https://p5js.org/libraries/) for inspiration.

Creating a library is a excellent stepping stone into the world of open source contributions. Don't underestimate how valuable of an experience this can be. The author of the py5 library started with open source by creating the Processing libraries Camera3D and Colorblindness. While doing these things, he learned a lot about the inner workings of Processing, and that knowledge provided the initial spark that led to the creation of py5.
