# Py5Graphics.flush()

Flush drawing commands to the renderer.

## Description

Flush drawing commands to the renderer. For most renderers, this method does absolutely nothing. There are not a lot of good reasons to use this method, but if you need it, it is available for your use.

This method is the same as [](sketch_flush) but linked to a `Py5Graphics` object.

Underlying Processing method: PGraphics.flush

## Signatures

```python
flush() -> None
```
