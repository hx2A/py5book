------

.. code:: python

    triangle(x1: float, y1: float, x2: float, y2: float, x3: float, y3: float, /) -> None

Parameters
----------

* **x1**: `float` - x-coordinate of the first point
* **x2**: `float` - x-coordinate of the second point
* **x3**: `float` - x-coordinate of the third point
* **y1**: `float` - y-coordinate of the first point
