Py5Graphics.triangle()
======================

A triangle is a plane created by connecting three points.

Description
-----------

A triangle is a plane created by connecting three points. The first two arguments specify the first point, the middle two arguments specify the second point, and the last two arguments specify the third point.

This method is the same as :doc:`sketch_triangle` but linked to a ``Py5Graphics`` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see :doc:`sketch_triangle`.

Underlying Processing method: PGraphics.triangle

Signatures
----------

.. code:: python

    triangle(
        x1: float,  # x-coordinate of the first point
        y1: float,  # y-coordinate of the first point
        x2: float,  # x-coordinate of the second point
        y2: float,  # y-coordinate of the second point
        x3: float,  # x-coordinate of the third point
        y3: float,  # y-coordinate of the third point
        /,
