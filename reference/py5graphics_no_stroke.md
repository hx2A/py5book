# Py5Graphics.no_stroke()

Disables drawing the stroke (outline).

## Description

Disables drawing the stroke (outline). If both `no_stroke()` and [](py5graphics_no_fill) are called, nothing will be drawn to the screen.

This method is the same as [](sketch_no_stroke) but linked to a `Py5Graphics` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see [](sketch_no_stroke).

Underlying Processing method: PGraphics.noStroke

## Signatures

```python
no_stroke() -> None
```
