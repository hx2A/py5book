## Description

This method has additional color functionality that is not reflected in the method's signatures. For example, you can pass the name of a color (e.g. "green", "mediumpurple", etc). Look at the online ["All About Colors"](/integrations/colors) Python Ecosystem Integration tutorial for more information.

This method is the same as [](sketch_brightness) but linked to a `Py5Graphics` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see [](sketch_brightness).

Underlying Processing method: PGraphics.brightness

## Signatures

```python
brightness(
    rgb: int,  # any value of the color datatype
    /,
) -> float
```
