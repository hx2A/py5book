# Py5Graphics.triangle()

A triangle is a plane created by connecting three points.

## Description

A triangle is a plane created by connecting three points. The first two arguments specify the first point, the middle two arguments specify the second point, and the last two arguments specify the third point.

This method is the same as [](sketch_triangle) but linked to a `Py5Graphics` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see [](sketch_triangle).

Underlying Processing method: PGraphics.triangle

## Signatures

```python
triangle(
    x1: float,  # x-coordinate of the first point
    y1: float,  # y-coordinate of the first point
    x2: float,  # x-coordinate of the second point
    y2: float,  # y-coordinate of the second point
    x3: float,  # x-coordinate of the third point
    y3: float,  # y-coordinate of the third point
    /,
) -> None
```
