# Python Ecosystem Integrations

The goal of py5 is to create a new version of Processing that is integrated into
the Python ecosystem. As the library has evolved over the years, this has become
one of its greatest strengths.

These integrations provide educators with opportunities to explore these
Python libraries with their students within the context of creative coding.
We believe that "Knowing Python" is as much about learning how to navigate the
Python library eosystem as it is about learning proper Python syntax.

These integrations also make py5 much easier to maintain. A key design
principal behind py5 is to leverage the strengths of other Python libraries and
the hard work of those library's maintainers and communities. As you learn
more about Python, you will find that this is a good design principal for Python
projects in general.

The purpose of this section is to articulate which Python libraries py5 is
integrated with and how to make best use of these integrations.
