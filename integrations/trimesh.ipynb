    "# 3D Shapes and Trimesh\n",
    "\n",
    "[Trimesh](https://trimesh.org/) is a well-known and well-maintained library for working with 3D geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of Trimesh is to \"provide a full featured and well tested Trimesh object which allows for easy manipulation and analysis, in the style of the Polygon object in the Shapely library.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Trimesh and [](/reference/sketch_convert_shape) can greatly extend py5's ability to load 3D objects, far exceeding what can be achieved with [](/reference/sketch_load_shape).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, know that Trimesh is a large and complex library. It is possible (likely) that there are Trimesh features that don't work well with py5's [](/reference/sketch_convert_shape) method. If you find something that doesn't work but should or have ideas for how py5's Trimesh integrations can be improved, please let us know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/py5coding/py5generator/issues) or starting a thread in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/py5coding/py5generator/discussions).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing Trimesh by itself is acceptable but Trimesh is much more useful if you install its dependent libraries. At a minimum, you should install the easy to install dependencies with this command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install trimesh[easy]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to the [Trimesh Installation page](https://trimesh.org/install.html) for more information about Trimesh's dependencies and installation options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Development of py5's integration code was done with Trimesh version 3.23. Version 4.0 was released shortly after but seems to work just as well as 3.23.\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) or [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) on your computer may also be useful. Trimesh can use these to perform boolean operations on 3D objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "If Trimesh is missing a dependent library needed for the functionality you want to use, it will provide you with an error message informing you of what you should install.\n",
    "\n",
