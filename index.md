# Welcome to py5!

py5 is a new version of [Processing](https://processing.org/) that runs in
Python 3.8+ using [JPype](https://jpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

The goal of this project is to create a version of Processing that fits into
the larger Python ecosystem. The library and this website are both a work
in progress.
