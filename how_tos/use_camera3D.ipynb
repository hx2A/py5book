This will create what is effectively a view into what is being displayed on that Sketch window running in the cloud. To be clear, although you will see a live animation in the Sketch Portal, the Sketch is not actually running in your browser. Itâ€™s kind of like when you watch a live television program on your TV. The live events are taking place somewhere else, but images of the events are being broadcast to your television.\n",
