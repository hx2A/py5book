    "# How to Generate Pseudorandom Noise\n",
    "\n",
    "[Pseudo-random noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_noise) functions can create sequences of numbers that seem random and unpredictable but are actually generated by repeatable, deterministic processes. These algorithms can be useful for various goals such as generating random textures and animating digital characters moving across the screen.\n",

    "This library provides two algorithms for you to use to generate noise: the OpenSimplex algorithm and the Processing Noise algorithm.\n",

It works well but has a few bugs, one of which can cause a py5 Sketch to suffer a segmentation fault. Unfortunately the library has not had a release in years so the bugs are not likely to be fixed. For these reasons and a few others, py5 can't have this library as a dependency and was removed. However, you may find it useful to install this library on your own if you want to use Perlin noise.\n",

    "* [opensimplex][4]: Pure Python implementation of the OpenSimplex algorithm. If you install the optional dependency Numba, this library will be significantly faster than py5's open simplex implementation.\n",
    "* [UniformNoise][5]: If you are willing to setup and work with a Java library, give the Uniform Noise library a try. The generated values will be uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.\n",
