# How to Generate Pseudorandom Noise

[Pseudo-random noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_noise) functions can create sequences of numbers that seem random and unpredictable but are actually generated by repeatable, deterministic processes.


Overview of how to use py5's noise functionality.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import py5
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
py5.noise(1.3)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3

```

## Other Options

If neither of :doc:`sketch_noise` nor :doc:`sketch_os_noise` meet your needs, there are other Python libraries available that you can use instead.

* [noise][1]: earlier versions of py5 used this library to provide Perlin Noise and Simplex Noise. The library uses compiled c code to generate the noise values. It works well but has a few bugs. Unfortunately the library has not had a release in years, and for various reasons that makes it difficult for py5 to have this library as a dependency.
* [vec-noise][2]:
* [pnoise][3]: Pure Python implementation of Processing's noise algorithm.
* [vnoise][4]: Pure Python implementation of Ken Perlin's Improved Noise function.
* [opensimplex][5]: Pure Python implementation of the OpenSimplex algorithm. If you install the optional dependency Numba, the library can be faster than py5's open simplex implementation.
